# Create Fill-in-the-Blank Question for "{{ word }}" ({{ word_type }})

## Word Information
**Definition**: {{ definition }}
{% if examples %}**Examples**: {{ examples }}{% endif %}

Create a GRE-level fill-in-the-blank question that:
- Tests semantic understanding, not rote memorization
- Uses sophisticated context requiring genuine comprehension
- Creates a sentence where the word is essential to meaning
- Provides appropriate academic rigor

## Guidelines
- Make the sentence challenging but not artificially obscure
- The blank should be unambiguous when context is understood
- Use vocabulary appropriate for graduate-level assessment
- Avoid overly technical jargon unless the word itself is technical
- Only provide a hint if the sentence context is insufficient
- Use academic vocabulary befitting standardized test preparation

Generate a structured response with the sentence and optional hint.
