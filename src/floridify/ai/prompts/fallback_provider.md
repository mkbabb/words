# Generate Dictionary Entry for "{{ word }}"

Create a comprehensive dictionary entry with:

-   All applicable word types (noun, verb, adjective, etc.)
-   Clear, concise definitions for each type
-   Mimic academic dictionary style, Ã  la Oxford or Merriam-Webster

Ensure that no duplicate definitions are included, even if they vary slightly in wording. For example, if the word "Comme il faut" has multiple word types (adjective, phrase), and these overlap significantly, only include the most relevant definition once.

If the word is nonsense or invalid, set the provider data to `None` and return an empty response.

Return a complete provider data structure.
