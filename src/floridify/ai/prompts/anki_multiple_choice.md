# Create Multiple Choice Question for "{{ word }}" ({{ word_type }})

## Word Information
**Definition**: {{ definition }}
{% if examples %}**Examples**: {{ examples }}{% endif %}

Create a GRE-level multiple choice question that:
- Tests precise definitional knowledge
- Uses plausible but incorrect distractors
- Maintains academic assessment standards
- Targets conceptual understanding over recognition

## Guidelines
- Make distractors semantically related but clearly distinct
- Avoid trick questions or overly subtle distinctions
- Use vocabulary appropriate for standardized test preparation
- One option should be the precise definition, others should be clearly wrong to an informed reader
- Test meaning comprehension, not word association
- Create four distinct choices with only one correct answer

Generate a structured response with four labeled choices and the correct answer.
