# Testing Strategy - Floridify

## Overview

Comprehensive test suite ensuring robustness, reproducibility, and regression prevention across all core functionality. KISS-driven approach with zero superfluity.

## Testing Philosophy

- **Pragmatic Coverage**: Test behavior, not implementation details
- **Regression Prevention**: Critical paths must have test coverage
- **Mock External Dependencies**: No real API calls, DB connections in tests
- **Fast Execution**: Sub-10 second full suite runtime target
- **Deterministic Results**: No flaky tests, reproducible across environments

```

### Test Categories

**Unit Tests** (80% of coverage)
- Individual class/function behavior
- Edge cases, error conditions
- Input validation, type safety

**Integration Tests** (15% of coverage)
- Component interaction
- Database operations
- CLI command flows

**Quality Tests** (5% of coverage)
- Search algorithm accuracy
- AI synthesis quality
- Performance benchmarks

## Core Testing Libraries

- **pytest** 8.0+ with asyncio support
- **hypothesis** for property-based testing
- **pytest-cov** for coverage tracking
- **unittest.mock** for external dependencies

## Mock Strategy

### Database Mocking
```python
@pytest.fixture
async def mock_db():
    """In-memory MongoDB alternative for tests."""
    # Motor mock with Beanie Document behavior
```

### API Mocking
```python
@pytest.fixture
def mock_openai():
    """Mock OpenAI API responses."""
    # Structured response simulation
```

### File System Mocking
```python
@pytest.fixture
def mock_cache():
    """Temporary cache directory."""
    # Isolated test file operations
```

## Test Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation (Priority: High)
- [ ] Migrate search quality tests from standalone file
- [ ] Create unified conftest.py with all mocking fixtures
- [ ] Establish unit test patterns for models, utils
- [ ] Mock database operations with Beanie ODM

### Phase 2: Core Components (Priority: High) 
- [ ] AI system testing with OpenAI mocking
- [ ] Search engine component tests
- [ ] Dictionary connector testing (Wiktionary focus)
- [ ] Normalization and utilities coverage

### Phase 3: Integration (Priority: Medium)
- [ ] End-to-end pipeline testing
- [ ] CLI command integration
- [ ] Anki generation workflow
- [ ] Error handling and recovery

### Phase 4: Quality Assurance (Priority: Low)
- [ ] Performance benchmarking
- [ ] Memory usage validation
- [ ] Concurrency stress testing
- [ ] Real-world data validation

## Coverage Targets

- **Unit Tests**: 95% line coverage minimum
- **Integration Tests**: All critical paths covered
- **Quality Tests**: Algorithm accuracy > 80% for test cases

## Execution Strategy

### Local Development
```bash
# Fast unit tests only
uv run pytest tests/unit/ -v

# Full test suite
uv run pytest --cov=src/floridify --cov-report=term-missing

# Quality validation
uv run pytest tests/quality/ -v
```

### CI/CD Integration
- All tests must pass before merge
- Coverage regression prevention
- Performance regression detection

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- **Tautological Testing**: Don't test what you just wrote
- **Implementation Testing**: Test behavior, not internal structure  
- **Flaky Tests**: No random data, timing dependencies
- **Verbose Tests**: Each test should fit on one screen
- **Commented Code**: Fix or delete, never comment out functionality

## Success Criteria

1. **Zero Flaky Tests**: 100% deterministic results
2. **Fast Execution**: <10 seconds for unit tests
3. **High Coverage**: >95% line coverage on core components
4. **Regression Prevention**: Critical bugs caught before production
5. **Developer Productivity**: Tests aid debugging, don't hinder development
