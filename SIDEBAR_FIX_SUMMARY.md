# Progressive Sidebar Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. SearchBar.vue - Fixed "Cannot access 'containerStyle' before initialization" error
- Moved the `useScrollAnimationSimple` hook before the watch statement that references `containerStyle`
- This ensures `containerStyle` is defined before it's accessed in the watch callback

### 2. ProgressiveSidebar.vue - Fixed sticky positioning
- Added explicit height constraints with `height: fit-content` and `maxHeight: calc(100vh - 2rem)`
- Made the nav container scrollable with proper overflow handling and custom scrollbar styling
- Ensured the sidebar only takes up as much height as needed, not full viewport height

### 3. DefinitionDisplay.vue - Fixed sidebar integration
- Simplified the sidebar inclusion to use proper sticky positioning
- Added `self-start` class to ensure the sidebar sticks to its own height
- Set appropriate z-index (40) to maintain proper layering with other sticky elements

## Key Changes

### ProgressiveSidebar.vue
```vue
<!-- Root container with height constraints -->
<div 
  class="themed-card themed-shadow-lg bg-background/95 backdrop-blur-sm rounded-lg p-2 space-y-0.5"
  :style="{ height: 'fit-content', maxHeight: 'calc(100vh - 2rem)' }"
>
  <!-- Scrollable nav container -->
  <nav class="space-y-0.5 overflow-y-auto overflow-x-hidden" 
       style="max-height: calc(100vh - 4rem); scrollbar-width: thin;">
```

### DefinitionDisplay.vue
```vue
<ProgressiveSidebar 
  v-if="shouldShowSidebar" 
  :groupedDefinitions="groupedDefinitions"
  class="hidden w-48 flex-shrink-0 xl:block sticky top-4 self-start"
  style="z-index: 40;"
/>
```

## Expected Behavior
- Sidebar sticks to the top when scrolling (with 1rem offset)
- Only takes up as much height as its content requires
- Scrolls internally when content exceeds viewport height
- Maintains proper z-index layering with search bar (z-40 vs z-40)
- Works smoothly with the rest of the page layout
