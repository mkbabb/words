# Tabs Component Improvements

## Overview
The Tabs components have been refactored to use our design system utilities, improving readability and consistency.

## Changes Made

### TabsTrigger.vue
**Before:** Single long line with 150+ characters
**After:** Organized into logical groups with comments

Key improvements:
- Uses `hover-lift-sm` for subtle hover effect
- Uses `focus-ring` utility for consistent focus states
- Uses `transition-smooth` for consistent transitions
- Prevents hover scale on active state with `data-[state=active]:hover:scale-100`
- Classes organized into logical sections with comments

### TabsList.vue
- Added `transition-smooth` for consistent transitions

### TabsContent.vue
- Replaced long focus chain with `focus-ring` utility
- Added subtle fade-in animation when content changes
- Simplified class structure

## Usage Example

```vue
<template>
  <div class="w-full max-w-md">
    <Tabs default-value="account" class="w-full">
      <TabsList class="grid w-full grid-cols-2">
        <TabsTrigger value="account">Account</TabsTrigger>
        <TabsTrigger value="password">Password</TabsTrigger>
      </TabsList>
      
      <TabsContent value="account">
        <Card>
          <CardHeader>
            <CardTitle>Account</CardTitle>
          </CardHeader>
          <CardContent>
            Make changes to your account here.
          </CardContent>
        </Card>
      </TabsContent>
      
      <TabsContent value="password">
        <Card>
          <CardHeader>
            <CardTitle>Password</CardTitle>
          </CardHeader>
          <CardContent>
            Change your password here.
          </CardContent>
        </Card>
      </TabsContent>
    </Tabs>
  </div>
</template>
```

## Design Benefits

1. **Consistency**: All tab triggers now have the same hover effect as buttons
2. **Accessibility**: Focus states are consistent across all interactive elements
3. **Performance**: Using predefined utilities reduces CSS bundle size
4. **Maintainability**: Organized classes are easier to understand and modify
5. **Animation**: Subtle content transitions improve perceived performance

## Future Enhancements

Consider creating tab variants:
- `variant="underline"` - Underline style tabs
- `variant="pills"` - Pill-shaped background
- `size="sm|md|lg"` - Different sizing options

These could be implemented using CVA similar to the Button component.
