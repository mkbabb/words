# Development Status

## Current State: Production Ready

**Last Updated**: 2025-07-02

## Core Features ✅ COMPLETE

### AI-Enhanced Dictionary System
- **Meaning-Based Clustering**: AI identifies distinct semantic meanings before synthesis
- **Hierarchical Display**: Multiple meanings with Unicode superscripts and separate panels
- **Lookup Pipeline**: Complete word processing: normalize → search → provider → AI synthesis → cache
- **Smart Caching**: MongoDB-based caching with automatic freshness validation
- **Multi-Language**: English and French lexicons with extensible framework

### Search Engine
- **Multi-Method Search**: Exact, fuzzy, semantic, and hybrid search with FAISS acceleration
- **Performance**: Sub-second search across 269k+ words with intelligent caching
- **Graceful Degradation**: Automatic fallback chain with timeout protection
- **Phrase Support**: Multi-word expression handling with proper normalization

### Word List Management
- **Batch Processing**: Full dictionary lookup pipeline for word lists (10 words/batch)
- **Format Support**: Auto-detection of numbered, CSV, tab-separated, and plain text formats
- **Frequency Tracking**: Word interest measurement with heat map visualization
- **Auto-Naming**: Animal phrase generation with collision handling
- **CRUD Operations**: Complete CLI interface for word list management

### CLI Interface
- **Homogeneous Design**: Consistent enum-based options across all commands
- **Rich Formatting**: Beautiful terminal output with progress tracking and heat maps
- **Command Groups**: `lookup`, `search`, `word-list`, `config`, `database`
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error messages with helpful suggestions

## Recent Improvements

### 2025-07-02: Word List System
- ✅ Implemented complete word list functionality with batch dictionary lookup
- ✅ Added frequency tracking and heat map visualization
- ✅ Created shared lookup core pipeline for consistency between commands
- ✅ Fixed Wiktionary connector method name (`fetch_definition` vs `get_definition`)
- ✅ Added enum-based CLI options for provider and language selection

### 2025-07-02: Code Quality & Documentation
- ✅ Renamed `process` command to `word-list` for clarity
- ✅ Moved lookup core to `cli/utils/` for better organization
- ✅ Fixed all MyPy and Ruff errors across codebase
- ✅ Updated pyproject.toml to ignore line length warnings
- ✅ Streamlined documentation to be KISS-compliant and current-state focused

### 2025-07-01: Core System Completion
- ✅ Implemented AI-powered meaning clustering with hierarchical display
- ✅ Fixed caching and database integration issues
- ✅ Added comprehensive search engine with multiple algorithms
- ✅ Created robust error handling and graceful degradation

## Architecture Health

### Code Quality
- **Type Safety**: MyPy strict mode passing
- **Linting**: Ruff formatting and checks passing
- **Performance**: Efficient caching and batch processing
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error recovery and timeout protection

### Database Integration
- **MongoDB**: Beanie ODM with proper indexing and validation
- **Caching**: Multi-level caching (memory → disk → database)
- **Storage**: Word lists, definitions, and API responses properly cached

### Current Limitations
- **Provider Integration**: Wiktionary working; Oxford/Dictionary.com need method fixes
- **Language Support**: English/French implemented; others need lexicon sources
- **Web Interface**: CLI only (no web interface planned)

## Development Commands

```bash
# Setup and development
uv venv && source .venv/bin/activate && uv sync

# Core workflows
uv run ./scripts/floridify lookup serendipity
uv run ./scripts/floridify search init
uv run ./scripts/floridify search word "cogn"
uv run ./scripts/floridify word-list create data/words.txt --name vocab

# Quality checks
uv run mypy src/ --ignore-missing-imports
uv run ruff check src/
```
