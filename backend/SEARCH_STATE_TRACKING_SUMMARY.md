# Search Pipeline State Tracking Integration Summary

## Overview
Successfully integrated state tracking into the search pipeline (`/backend/src/floridify/core/search_pipeline.py`) to provide real-time progress updates and performance metrics during search operations.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added StateTracker Parameter
- Added optional `state_tracker: StateTracker | None = None` parameter to:
  - `search_word_pipeline()`
  - `find_best_match()`
  - `search_similar_words()`
- Maintains backward compatibility - state tracking is optional

### 2. Progress Tracking Stages
The pipeline now tracks progress through these stages:

#### Query Processing (0-20%)
- **search_query_processing** (5%): Initial query received
- **search_query_normalized** (10%): Query normalization applied
- **search_method_selection** (20%): Search methods determined

#### Search Execution (20-70%)
- Dynamic progress allocation based on number of search methods
- Tracks each method individually:
  - `PipelineStage.SEARCH_EXACT`
  - `PipelineStage.SEARCH_FUZZY`
  - `PipelineStage.SEARCH_SEMANTIC`
  - `search_prefix` (custom stage)
- Updates after each method with partial results

#### Result Processing (70-95%)
- **search_deduplication** (75%): Removing duplicate results
- **search_filtering** (85%): Filtering by minimum score
- **PipelineStage.SEARCH_RANKING** (95%): Sorting by relevance

#### Completion (100%)
- **PipelineStage.COMPLETED**: Success with final results
- **PipelineStage.ERROR**: On failure with error details

### 3. Performance Metrics
State updates include detailed metadata:
- Query and normalized query
- Selected search methods
- Results per search method
- Time per search method (ms)
- Total pipeline time (ms)
- Result counts at each stage

### 4. Partial Results
- After each search method, includes top 3 partial results in state data
- Final state includes top 5 results
- Allows UI to show results as they're found

### 5. Implementation Details
- Created `_search_with_state_tracking()` helper function
- Maintains singleton search engine behavior
- Zero impact when state_tracker is None
- Thread-safe state updates using StateTracker's async queue

## Usage Example

```python
from floridify.models.pipeline_state import StateTracker
from floridify.core.search_pipeline import search_word_pipeline

# Create state tracker
tracker = StateTracker()

# Monitor state updates
async def monitor():
    async for state in tracker.get_state_updates():
        print(f"{state.progress*100:.0f}% - {state.stage}: {state.message}")
        if state.stage in ("completed", "error"):
            break

# Run search with tracking
monitor_task = asyncio.create_task(monitor())
results = await search_word_pipeline(
    "example",
    state_tracker=tracker
)
await monitor_task
```

## Test Script
Created `/backend/test_search_state_tracking.py` to demonstrate:
- Real-time progress bar updates
- Performance metric tracking
- Partial result streaming
- Error handling with state updates

## Benefits
1. **User Experience**: Real-time feedback during searches
2. **Performance Monitoring**: Detailed timing metrics per search method
3. **Debugging**: Clear visibility into search pipeline stages
4. **Streaming Results**: Can show partial results as found
5. **Error Transparency**: Clear error reporting with context

## No Breaking Changes
- All functions maintain backward compatibility
- State tracking is completely optional
- No changes to search engine singleton behavior
- No performance impact when not using state tracking
