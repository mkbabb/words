# Frequency Band Assessment

Assess the frequency band for the word "{{ word }}" with the following definition:

**Definition**: {{ definition }}

## Frequency Bands:
1. **Band 1**: Most frequent 1000 words (everyday essentials)
2. **Band 2**: Next 1000 words (common vocabulary)
3. **Band 3**: Next 1000 words (familiar but less common)
4. **Band 4**: Next 2000 words (educated/literary vocabulary)
5. **Band 5**: Beyond top 5000 (specialized/rare)

## Assessment Criteria:
- Consider general English usage, not specialized contexts
- Focus on written and spoken frequency combined
- Account for all common meanings of the word
- Base on contemporary usage (last 20 years)

## Example Reasoning:
- "the" → Band 1 (article, used constantly)
- "happy" → Band 1 (basic emotion, very common)
- "computer" → Band 2 (common in modern life)
- "eloquent" → Band 4 (educated vocabulary)
- "perspicacious" → Band 5 (rare, literary)

Provide the frequency band (1-5) with clear reasoning.
