# Register Classification

Classify the register level of the following definition:

**Definition**: {{ definition }}

## Register Levels:
- **formal**: Academic, official, or professional language
- **informal**: Casual, everyday conversation
- **neutral**: Standard language, neither formal nor informal
- **slang**: Very informal, often generational or cultural
- **technical**: Specialized jargon for specific fields

## Classification Guidelines:
1. Analyze the definition's wording and style
2. Consider the contexts where this definition would be used
3. Look for register markers (contractions, technical terms, etc.)
4. Choose the most appropriate single category

## Examples:
- "To make something move faster" → neutral
- "To accelerate the velocity of an object" → formal/technical
- "To speed something up" → informal
- "To make something go zoom" → slang
